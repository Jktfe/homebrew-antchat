# Homebrew formula for antchat — the lightweight ANT chat client.
#
# This file lives in the source repo for reference + CI bookkeeping.
# The version that users actually install lives in the tap repo:
#   https://github.com/Jktfe/homebrew-antchat (Formula/antchat.rb)
#
# The release workflow (.github/workflows/release-antchat.yml) emits a
# GitHub Release tagged `antchat-v<version>` with two binary tarballs and
# a SHA256SUMS file. After tagging, the tap formula's `url` and `sha256`
# fields below are bumped to the new release.
#
# Install:
#   brew tap jktfe/antchat
#   brew install antchat
#
# Or directly:
#   brew install jktfe/antchat/antchat
